- 👋 Hello! My name is Andrew Childs and I am a junior at University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in Computer Science. Here is a more thorough
  summary on the CS classes I've taken so far at UMass:
    - CS 121: This is an introduction to programming class taught in Java. This class teaches Object Oriented Programming and Classes, basic
      data types, inheritance, loops, interfaces, recursion, etc.
    - CS 187: This is a data structures and algorithms class taught in Java. This class teaches about the basics of run time (Big O), sorting 
      algorithms and their respective run times (such as merge, insertion, bubble, etc.), and data structures (such as linked lists, hash tables,
      graphs, etc.)
    - CS 220: This is a programming methodology class (focused on writing efficient code) taught in Javascript. This class teaches higher order
      functions in Javascript (such as filter, reduce, etc.), testing code w/ unit tests AND property tests, pointers/references, streams, garbage 
      collection, error handling, and finite state automata
    - CS 230: This is a computer systems principles class (focused on learning about the basics of how a computer runs) in C. This class teaches
      pointers and references to memory, bits and data representation, the kernel, how Assembly works, system calls and signals,caching data in RAM, 
      processes, threads, and networking (sockets, TDP/UDP, etc.)
    - CS 240: This a reasoning under uncertainty class (focused on statistics and probability). This class teaches the summation and
      multiplication of probabilities, Bayes' rule, permutations and combinations, discrete and continuous random variables, expected value, 
      centrl limit theorem (normal model), Markov/Chebyshev inequalities, and Markov chains
    - CS 250: This is an intro to computation class (focused on logic and boolean algebra). This class teaches the basics of boolean algebra, 
      De Morgan's law, basic proof methods (such as Hypothetical Syllogism), propositional logic and predicates, quantifiers, partial and total orders,
      proof by induction, Breadth and depth first search, uniform cost search, A star search, regular expressions, and Kleene's theorem (DFA/NFAs)
    - CS 311: This is an intro to algorithms course. I have not finished this course yet, however here is what the class has taught me so far:
